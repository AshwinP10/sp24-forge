**Not Accepted**

The submission is missing several key documents and confirmations required by the decision tree:

* **Section A: Product-Specific Documents:**  The submission doesn't specify whether it's offering products, services, or both.  If products are involved, several Section A requirements are likely unmet (TAA Compliance, Letter of Supply (potentially), EULA (potentially), Section 508 compliance, AbilityOne compliance, commercial price list).

* **Section B: Service-Specific Documents:**  If services are involved, 3+ past performance questionnaires or CPARS are required,  and potentially a Price Narrative and Pricing Proposal Templates, and a Labor Matrix.

* **Additional Compliance:**  An Agent Authorization Letter is required given the use of Coley GCS.  The submission regarding continuous contracts/streamlining modifications needs clarification.  Information on single-use plastics is also missing.


**Things to watch for:** While the SAM registration is active and Pathways to Success and Readiness Assessment are complete,  thorough review of *all* sections A and B and the final compliance checklist is critical before acceptance.  Inconsistencies in the offer regarding the nature of the provided services/products need to be addressed.
