Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C.6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.

A DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKETING STRATEGY THAT WILL BE USED TO REACH FEDERAL ORDERING ACTIVITIES . Over the last decade, NSI has supported many government and commercial clients from defense, intelligence, gaming, digital entertainment, business intelligence, and customer service. We have provided solutions to a wide variety of critical analytical and d ecision -making problems. Our solutions have enabled our clients to better understand people and their behaviors such as at -risk populations, market segments, multiplayer engagement, brand loyalty, and customer satisfaction . We believe that these organizati ons will benefit the most from our services as they often require more advanced solutions to maintain their competitive edge. We understand the US Government is the number one buyer of goods and services in the world, and offering services awarded under our own GSA Schedule contract is simply our first step in marketing to the US Government. At NSI we plan on taking steps to publicize our MAS GSA Schedule. We also understand by uploading our awarded GSA Pricelist on GSA eLibrary, Federal agencies will have open access to our GSA awarded services catalog. In addition, we intend to utilize GSA’s eBuy system to the fullest extent pos sible and will have federal sales professionals on our government services branch fully dedicated to responding to Request for Quote (RFQs) and Request for Proposal (RFPs). Projected sales: NSI anticipates sales of at least $ 125,000 annually during our first full contract year on the GSA Schedule. We believe these sales will come through the diversion of existing Federal Government sales, reselling software with niche technology capabilities, as well as identifying and cultivating new clients. A DISCUSSION REGARDING THE INTENDED USE OF SUBCONTRACTORS . As a small business, NSI is not required to use subcontractors in the delivery of our services. However, if the need arises, we will use subcontractors to deliver full solutions to our customers. NSI is able to propose a variety of positions as our comprehensive recruitment and screening program allows us to select high -level talent with appropriate certifications and qualifications. NSI recruits and fields the talent required to transform, sustain, and secure enterprise federal environments.

Factor Three: Quality Control Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal. National Security Innovations, Inc. Proprietary Information DESCRIPTION OF INTERNAL REVIEW PROCEDURES THAT FACILITATE HIGH -QUALITY STANDARDS Our Quality Control Plan (QCP) is based upon the PWS covering all functional areas that will be monitored with tangible metrics ensuring consistent quality assurance. Our approach is to baseline existing Quality Control (QC) processes and to validate current metrics and objectives. From this baseline, we will work with the project and TO stakeholder to determine if documented processes and measures are effective and determine if additional ones may be required to meet quality standards. The QC process will help our Program Manager (PM) to monitor and control project services – by identifying and correcting deficiencies in quality performance before they become unacceptable – and to assist in continuous improvement of service. IDENTIFICATION OF INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING QUALITY CONTROL . The PM is responsible for oversight of all program activities. Our on-site management of the QCP will be assigned to a Quality Control Manager (QCM) who will report directly to the PM. This supervisory chain ensures the QCM can execute their responsibilities as an independent auditor and report their findings on the quality of program performance directly to NSI Corporate Quality leadership and/or to GSA leadership. The benefits of incorporating such detailed layers focused on quality ensure services are administered correctly and consistently throughout the project lifecycle. WHETHER OR NOT SUBCONTRACTORS ARE USED AND , IF SO , THE QUALITY CONTROL MEASURES USED TO ENSURE ACCEPTABLE SUBCONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE . As a small business, NSI is not required to use subcontractors in the delivery of our services. However, if the need arises, we will use subcontractors to deliver full solutions to our customers. NSI is able to propose a variety of positions as our comprehensive recruitment and screening program allows us to select high -level talent with appropriate certifications and qualifications. NSI recruits and fields the talent required to transform, sustain, and secure enterprise federal environments. HOW POTENTIAL PROBLEM AREAS AND SOLUTIONS ARE HANDLED NSI checks in regularly with clients and contractors often to help prevent serious issues from flaring up. If addressed early on, preventative measures will be taken to improve or alleviate any problems. NSI offers a strong support system for any individual on a contract at a client site. We work hard to build relationships with our employees and conduct status “check -ins” weekly or bi -weekly for our contractors. Errors, defects, issues, deviations, and noncompliance items identified in our performance of the project’s required services must be itemized, documented, tracked to closure, and reported by the QC M and QA teams. The QC M will verify all problems were tracked to closure and provide continuing feedback to management and the technical support team concerning the status of the problem. THE PROCEDURES FOR ENSURING QUALITY PERFORMANCE WHEN MEETING URGENT REQUIREMENTS . NSI is committed to providing the highest quality services to all of our clients by supporting urgent needs and rapid response programs involving complex technical solutions, diverse missions, and operational concerns. NSI always adheres to our QC/A procedures when new, and even urgent, requirements are identified. NSI has a commitment to maintaining quality while still meeting urgent requirements. Those requirements that demand immediate attention while still demanding high quality are best managed by those working directly on the project. NSI is capable of handling such tasks given our depth and breadth of experience, combined with the knowledge of the customer’s needs. Upon evaluation of the requirements and new urgent needs, our staff will immediately reprioritize their responsibilities in order to respond to the urgent need. The current staff working on the project will manage short -term urgent needs. While long-term urgent needs will be evaluated and the hiring of new staff for temporary or permanent employment will be executed. We also engage our corporate staff as reach back to increase the capacity of our Factor Three: Quality Control Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal. National Security Innovations, Inc. Proprietary Information technical/functional contract staff. NSI maintains an inventory of potential employee resumes, including those willing to work short term and those looking for permanent employment. HOW QUALITY CONTROL WILL BE MANAGED WHEN COMPLETING MULTIPLE PROJECTS FOR MULTIPLE AGENCIES SIMULTANEOUSLY . The factors listed above allow NSI to perform an extremely high number of task orders concurrently, ensuring that the firm has the ability to execute a variety of projects for a number of federal clients without sacrificing quality. In the event additional staff are required to support new projects, NSI will provide the right personnel at the right time by implementing our recruitment plan. Our in-house professional recruiting staff members work in step with our program management team to effectively utilize the plan, which offers fully integrated social media platforms, target niche job boards, electronic onboarding, and complete requisition and offer management. NSI ’s recruitment professionals ensure that the selection, screening, clearance verification, and hiring processes for this work are efficient, consistent, and effective at each step. Once candidates are identified, our recruitment staff efficiently match personnel against work requirements— expediting identification of the most highly qualified, experienced, and available candidates.

(1) Detailed description of SIN relevant work performed and results achieved The US Department of Defense (DoD) Strategic Multilayer Assessment (SMA) program is a multidisciplinary, multi- agency portfolio of projects that studies and assesses challenging problems associated with planning and operations of DoD, military services, and gover nment agencies. NSI has supported the SMA office for nearly a decade, providing a wide array of strategic analyses and research on a variety of national security and operational imperatives. NSI’s role is typically multifaceted, oftentimes responsible for overall research design, scoping and coordination with other organizations involved in SMA projects, and integration of the collective research ﬁndings and analyses. SMA projects tend to focus on national security events that span the globe, are complex, urgent, of criti cal importance, typically arise with little or no lead -time, and are short duration due to their real -world nature. Factor Four: Project Experience Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal. National Security Innovations, Inc. Proprietary Information The US faces increasingly complex national security issues in every area of the globe that require research, studies, development and validation of tools, and analytic methodologies to enable decision -makers to pivot rapidly across a wide array of operational imperatives. NSI staff possess a broad range of analytic competencies, extensive expertise, and many years of hands -on experience conducting research and creating methodologies tailored to these issues. SMA is a multi -disciplinary, multi -agency portfolio of projects that assess and study challenging “hard problems” associated with planning and operations of DoD, military services, and Government agencies. SMA projects involve intense yet ﬁnite study periods of six- to nine -months where proof -of-concept and prototype capabilities are developed and applied to overcome challenges. An extensive network of leading researchers and practitioners participate in SMA, spanning the DoD, intelligence community, the interagency, universities, industry, and national laboratories. SMA research is accepted, prioritized, and synchronized by the J oint Staff/J -39 DDGO and executed b y the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD (AT&L)) through the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Emerging Capability & Prototyping (DASD EC&P)/Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO). NSI supports SMA on project s ranging from nuclear non - proliferation on the Korean peninsula, the challenge of social unrest in emerging megacities, countering the emergent threat from ISIS, gray zone conﬂict from emerging near peers, and the challenges of competition in space. (2) Methodology, tools, and/or processes utilized in performing the work Our niche is helping clients better and more reliably understand people and their behaviors on critical, complex decision -making problems. Our capabilities are rooted in a highly diverse and experienced team of researchers and analysts applying multidisciplinary social science techniques and various analytic methods to create deeper analyses and clarifying insights enabling our clients to make more informed and better decisions. • Deeper Analyses: To create meaningful analyses one must move beyond asking “what happened” and instead ask “why it happened” and understand the conditions under which it might happen again. • Clarifying Insights: Data is abundant. Plots and graphs are easy. Insights are very hard. But when they are created, insights can be immensely powerful because they are actionable and create value for the client. • Better Decisions: Diversity provokes thought. Decades of research have shown that, for solving complex problems, diversity –a fundamental tenet of NSI –creates far better results than does homogeneity. (3) Demonstration of compliance with any applicable laws, regulations, Executive Orders, OMB Circulars, professional standards, etc. NSI performs all services within the established rules, regulations, and safety requirements. NSI ensured its complete understanding of all common law, federal, state and local laws, statutes, ordinances, codes, regulations, rules, requirements, polices, guidelines, court rulings, orders or determination of all governmental authorities, utility compan ies applicable to the services provided. (4) Project schedule (i.e., major milestones, tasks, deliverables), including an explanation of any delays Factor Four: Project Experience Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal. National Security Innovations, Inc. Proprietary Information NSI continuously exceeds expectations of the client on each task issued. NSI has not experienced any delays and all milestones and project deliverables have been met. Further, NSI monitors the progress of each task and provides weekly status reports to the client to ensure the successful completion of the project. NSI communicates with stakeholders including appropriate staff in the organization on the progress of the project. NSI reviews the quality of the work completed with the client on a regular basis to ensure that it meets the project standards. (5) How the work performed is similar in scope and complexity to the work solicited under the proposed SIN NSI staff provided social science expertise to compliment geospatial and all source intelligence analysis. The analytical processes developed included question formation, hypothesis development, data gathering, and analysis. Technological development included assessment of the software necessary for analysis and ultimate visualization as data, to include static representations up to interactive dashboards for nominal end users. (6) Demonstration of required specific experience and/or special qualifications detailed under the proposed SIN. Since its founding, NSI has worked on hundreds of projects for government and commercial clients. Our clients have become increasingly aware of the importance of accounting for the human component in their analytical and decision -making processes. However, many of their existing practices do not sufficiently accommodate such considerations. Helping clients understand people and their behaviors is precisely what we do. NSI’s multi -disciplinary staff has extensive expertise fusing social science disciplines to design and execute large, multi -stage, multi -team research programs and agendas that tackle national security problems. NSI’s proposed gray zone research program reﬂects our technical expertise as well as our experience. NSI is a virtually organized company with principal offices located in Boston, MA. The majority of our staff work out of home offices in close proximity to key clients spanning the US (MA, VA, NC, CA, IN, PA, CO, TX, IL, WA). NSI has invested signiﬁcantly in state -of-art information technology (IT) capabilities and enjoys a highly efficient distributed collaborative work environment across locations of our current staff.

In 1947, George Kennan wrote about containing the Soviet Union and communist expansion. Twenty-five years later Nixon and Kissinger revised containment to include détente with another communist country (China) as the best way to contain Russia, and during the 1980s, the Reagan Administration went about containment by way of defense spending and proxy warfare. The dissolution of the Soviet Union on the day after Christmas 1991, switched the strategic discussion in the US from containing Soviet global influence to defining the contours of the post-Cold War “new world order”, and characterizing the threats if any, to US interests that it posed. The debate continued for another ten years during which the US saw itself as the “sole superpower”, unchallenged militarily or economically by its nearest-peers. Ironically, it was a group of 19 individuals who ended US complacency in September 2001. What followed was nearly 20 years of military operations and supporting research first to understand, and then to craft strategies to counter radicalization, terrorism, and insurgency. The 2017 National Security Strategy and the subsequent 2018 National Defense Strategy) were the first since the 2001 attacks that did not include counter-terror as a significant defense priority. Instead, the documents turned US strategic attention to a turbulent international environment propelled by near-peers threatening US global interests. They did this not by projecting military power in conventional ways, but by employing “new” tactics in the “gray zone” or, more recently, the “competitive” zone. These include a rapidly expanding set of strategies and threats to US security interests that exceed acceptable competition but stay below the level of armed conflict. Gray Zone conflict lies between peace and war and manifests in constantly changing ways, creating the need for updated and evolving methodologies for preparing to meet these new and fluid challenges. Where we are Activities in the gray zone are by design ambiguous. It can be unclear who is responsible (e.g., media manipulation prior to the 2012 general election in the US); what the challenger’s ultimate objective may be (e.g., Chinese island building in the South China Sea) or even whether a challenge has taken place at all (e.g., Russian cyber efforts to spur civil conflict in Ukraine). However, one intention is clear: gray zone challenges are used to achieve a state’s objectives while frustrating US military or other punitive responses. There is not a single condition or definition that can distinguish an activity as within the “gray zone” independent of the geospatial and strategic contexts. Gray zone challenge can happen on multiple timescales, in different domains, in different locations, and on different levels of human society (e.g., global, regional, state, group and individual). The time scales are long and defy quick solutions to understand and counter. China has a much-touted 100-year strategy for world dominance, while the US works on four-year political cycles (Pillsbury 2015). Our strategic focus and supporting research must go beyond current frameworks. The combinations of these factors make for an operational setting that is extremely difficult to discern and understand, and poses a research problem that is intricately complex and non-deterministic and requires multiple iterations of multi-disciplinary and integrated solutions as well as geospatial customization to account for not only issues specific to different theater, but also capture nuances of likely responses from different population subgroups. 4 NSIRESEARCH ▪ INNOVATION ▪ EXCELLENCEWhere we need to be US adversaries have been convinced of US dominance in conventional military maneuver. As a result, near-peer states in particular have turned to human cognition and affect, cultural beliefs, master narratives, ethnic identities, access to information, and economic dependencies as critical conflict domains. In order to protect and advance US security, US decision makers and planners need reliable, adaptive and accessible methods and tools to help them think about, identify, diagnose, and understand gray zone challenges within their geospatial contexts. They need means of assuring, deterring and defeating in areas beyond traditional military domains and tactics and means of devising appropriate responses rather than relying on kinetic solutions only, but by using tools that are developed for this specific and very new type of strategic thinking. Currently, few tools exist, creating a critical need for advanced research on how to predict, assess, and manage the inter-relationships between cognition and emerging trends within societies, as well as responses to specific peer gray zone activities. How to get there While there is a good deal of historical and contemporary information about gray zone activities there is as yet, very little empirically tested and evaluated, accumulated knowledge about the use of gray zone strategies to gain security advantage. This knowledge is essential to guide US planners and strategists in navigating the rapidly evolving 21st Century global order as it emerges. NSI proposes to enhance knowledge and understanding of gray zone challenges, generate methods for assessment, and aid in identifying and planning effective defense by pursuing research in line with core types of gray zone strategy, each of which can manifest on geo-spatial levels ranging from global to the mind of an individual. Together, these gray zone strategy types and geospatial levels produce four proposed gray zone research topics (threads) as shown in Figure 1. below. These are: Stability and Instability, Indirect and Hybrid Threats, Communication and Information Operations, and Gray Zone Ambiguity Reduction. NSI's depth of experience researching gray zone topics, and unique analytic approach to national security problems makes it particularly well-suited to advance gray zone research in line with these four threads. Furthermore, NSI’s multi-disciplinary staff has extensive expertise fusing social science disciplines to design and execute large, multi-stage, multi-team research programs and agendas that tackle national security problems. NSI’s proposed gray zone research program reflects our technical expertise as well as our experience. Leading the effort for NSI shall be Dr. Allison Astorino-Courtois, Executive VP and Chief Analytics Officer. Dr. Astorino-Courtois has over 15 years of experience in quantitative political science and decision theoretic research, including nearly 13 years as technical lead of national security research and analyses. Supporting Dr. Astorino-Courtois shall be a team of NSI analysts and researchers including Dr. Lawrence Kuznar, Chief Cultural Sciences Officer; Ms. Sarah Canna, Principal Analyst; and Ms. Mariah Yager, Senior Research Scientist. 5 NSIRESEARCH ▪ INNOVATION ▪ EXCELLENCEVolume I – Technical Proposal 1.1 Technical Approach Despite our increasingly digital and virtual world, geography matters and as much for gray zone threats as for any others. Threats and opportunities play out in space; internet trolls operate out of specific locations (e.g., Macedonia, St. Petersburg), affecting people in other locations (France, Germany, Estonia, Ukraine), often producing broad geo-political impact. Supplying warfighters with the geographically sensitive knowledge they need requires innovative basic and applied research in geospatial and related sciences that characterize and measure phenomena across physical, cognitive, social, cyber, and ideological domains. These domains are overlapping and cross-cutting, no single domain has meaning outside its contextual relationship to others. Therefore, scientific approaches to understanding the interrelationships of these domains must include a suite of analytic methods and tools adaptable and tailorable to specific mission requirements in order to provide operators, analysts, strategists and decision makers a rich, contextual understanding of how physical, social, cultural and political factors play out in space. 1.2 Technical Discussion NSI's depth of experience researching gray zone topics and unique analytic approach to national security problems makes it particularly well-suited to advance gray zone understanding.1 Among other efforts, NSI has produced concept papers defining and validating operationalization of the gray zone concept, exploring transgression of international norms as a gray zone tactic, the gaps in US capability to counter gray zone activities that target the cognitive domain, and a series of case studies exploring the analytic power of discourse analysis for detecting gray zone strategies employed against the US. NSI has a unique, multi-disciplinary staff of researchers with extensive expertise in research design, hypothesis generation and in leveraging and creating analytic approaches across social science disciplines (i.e., human geography, anthropology, archeology, psychology, decision theory, international relations) to address topics of vital concern to the US national security community. NSI researchers also bring decades of combined experience executing large, multi-stage, multi-team research programs and agendas that tackle problems for which DOD lacks the necessary skills and intellectual networks to address appropriately. NSI’s proposed gray zone research program reflects our technical expertise as well as our experience working with Combatant Commanders and other senior DOD decision makers whose understanding of new types of challenges and conflict, and the implications for US policy and operations continues to evolve. In the following sections we first discuss the proposed substantive approach, and then briefly outline the foundations and process of NSI’s approach to research, analysis and transforming information into knowledge. 1 From 2016-2017, at the request of General Joseph Votel, NSI designed, participated in and executed one of the first research efforts to operationalize and test the concept of “gray zone warfare” put forward by Votel et al (2016). 6 NSIRESEARCH ▪ INNOVATION ▪ EXCELLENCESubstantive Approach to Gray Zone Research While there is a good deal of historical and contemporary information about gray zone activities there is as yet, very little, systematic concept development, or empirically tested and evaluated, accumulated knowledge about the use of gray zone strategies to gain security advantage. Unfortunately, there is a gap in the evidence-based knowledge essential to guide planners and strategists in navigating the rapidly evolving 21st Century global order as it emerges. This gap is the impetus for the proposed research program described below. NSI proposes to contribute to DOD understanding of gray zone challenges and conflict by undertaking a research program to produce refined analytic frameworks and prototype new methodologies specifically tailored to analysis of the gray zone environment. This is the core of the proposed research program. We use, the gray zone activities and strategies that planners and decision makers are most likely to face in the coming decade as an organizing structure (i.e., research agenda) for the proposed research We propose to conduct gray zone research in line with four of what we call gray zone research “threads” – or areas of knowledge. Each is described briefly below. • Stability and Instability Research Thread. Subverting political and economic stability in particular regions, particular states, or sub-state areas and populations has been used as a potent means for challenging US national interests, and/or achieving security gains at the expense of the US or its allies and partners short of the use of armed conflict. The importance of proximity and the contagion effects of instability are inherent geo-spatial aspects of this gray zone strategy. This is a gray zone strategy that has been used recently by Russia in Ukraine and Crimea. Understanding the stability Figure 1. NSI Gray Zone Research Program 7 NSIRESEARCH ▪ INNOVATION ▪ EXCELLENCEand instability dynamics of a locality, or polity is essential for countering destabilization as a gray zone strategy. • Indirect and Hybrid Threat Research Thread. Use of proxy actors or other forms of indirect challenge and aggression are also important gray zone tactics. For example, Iran has long backed Hezbollah as a standing and sometimes active deterrent threat against Israeli and US aggression. Likewise, North Korea’s unclaimed cyber-attacks against US corporations are intended to communicate its power to injure the US while preserving the regime’s plausible deniability and hindering US retaliation. Enhancing US capabilities to discover and verify the provenance of indirect aggression against the US or its allies is essential both for deterrence of subsequent gray zone activities and the credibility of US conventional deterrence. • Communication and Information Operations Research Thread. Targeting popular perceptions of governments, elected officials, the US or other issues by manipulating social media, public access to local political information and generating fake news has emerged as a particularly insidious gray zone strategy. It is also an area in which the US struggles to keep pace with less legally-encumbered peer competitors. There is a serious US capability gap that requires significant research into cultural and geo-spatial contextual differences in receptivity to all forms of communication (word and action) intended to persuade. • Gray Zone Ambiguity Reduction Research Thread. Ambiguity about the features of the operational context is a key characteristic of the gray zone, and a strategy to promote ambiguity and uncertainty can be particularly difficult to counter. In order to understand and ideally, anticipate another state’s actions, analysts and decision makers require a systematic, transparent and robust set of techniques to better understand the incentives and constraints that impact that actor’s decision making. NSI Research Methodology and Process The US faces increasingly complex national security issues in every area of the globe that require research, studies, development and validation of tools, and analytic methodologies to enable decision-makers to pivot rapidly across a wide array of operational imperatives. NSI staff possess a broad range of analytic competencies, extensive expertise, and many years of hands-on experience conducting research and creating methodologies tailored to these issues. While the four research threads indicate what NSI proposes to work on, the following section describes how NSI works. All of NSI’s research projects are based in behavioral social science and founded in systematic analysis employing the scientific method as adapted to the study of human society. Our technical approach, is consciously multi-disciplinary and multi-method intended to assess a problem from many different perspectives in order to develop a contextual understanding that is as nuanced and complete as possible. As a consequence, NSI research efforts are comprised of four main phases as shown in Figure 2, Phase 1— arguably the most critical phase— consists of careful definition of the research problem or objective. The criticality of, and expertise required for successful completion of this phase is underappreciated. NSI staff have decades of experience doing precisely this kind of problem definition and scoping experience. Creating a research program or study entails a fairly consistent set of steps each of which rely on the previous ones, and ultimately the value of the research question posed. During Phase 2, the single or multi-team (generally representing relevant disciplines and methods) research design is constructed. Primary tasks in this phase include development of a fully-specified analytic frame to guide generation of hypotheses, operationalized definition of 8 NSIRESEARCH ▪ INNOVATION ▪ EXCELLENCEresearch variables and the choice of analytical method(s) appropriate to the research question and observable (empirical) data. A carefully designed research effort leads the research team through the tasks necessary for successful completion. During Phase 3 NSI uses a number of data collection methods (e.g., global subject matter expert (SME) elicitation; theory and literature review; social media scraping; fusing of existing quantitative data sources; combing of historical records and cases, etc.). Hypotheses are tested and results evaluated per the design choices made during the previous phase. Analytical results are produced, and depending on the variety of methods used, findings from different components of the project are compared, validated and integrated. While coordination with other researchers and persistent internal review and revision occur throughout Phases 2 and 3, NSI adds an external review and evaluation step as Phase 4 to allow for community of practice peers and interested operator review to assure the analytic rigor and operational relevance of our studies. This can take many forms including scientific review groups, research presentations and conferences. Some of the techniques, models and methods that may be leveraged to support Phases 2-4 are elaborated below. Further Explanation of Phase 2 Execution The core of the proposed research is to develop concepts and methods applicable to the specific characteristics of operational environments in which gray zone strategies are used. Where appropriate, NSI will leverage earlier work done for the USG to understand gray zone concepts, and preliminary analytic frameworks (i.e., 6.1 research) for the proposed research. Specifically, NSI will test, refine, and evaluate Figure 3. Example Elements of a Gray Zone Research Project Figure 2. NSI Research, Development, Testing & Evaluation Process 9 NSIRESEARCH ▪ INNOVATION ▪ EXCELLENCEthese for construct validity and as user-friendly tools for gray zone analyses. If no feasible method, framework or tool exists, NSI shall create, and conduct systematic tests to refine new approaches and methodologies tailored for analysis of gray zone activities. Many aspects of gray zone research are agnostic to specific local or international actor (i.e., the same gray zone research might be conducted on China, Hezbollah, or Togo). Thus, in order to provide the DoD and AGC with added value, NSI will accept suggestions of real-world, gray zone use cases offered by the Joint Staff to use in the process of the gray zone research program. This represents a novel approach to applied research that directs it toward use cases representing current operational problems and decisions. The government receives both the core research output (concepts, methods and tools for the gray zone), plus timely analyses of issues of critical operational importance in the process. Examples of initial behavioral analytic expertise, frameworks, approaches and methodologies that NSI has developed are described below. Stability Model-based Analytic Methodology (NSI-developed) NSI’s stability model and analytic methodology is guided by an adaptable generic model tailored to reflect the historical, cultural, social and political contexts and structures of a particular location. It has been used in research on stability and instability dynamics in Afghanistan, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Palestinian Authority, and post-ISIS Iraq. The formalized concept model allows analysts and researchers to systematically and transparently uncover drivers of instability and stability buffers (areas of resilience). Research within the Stability & Instability thread will be used to adapt this model to gray zone-specific problems and challenges, customize the framework within geospatial contexts, and improve the validity of the model. Statistical Modeling NSI employs advanced statistical analyses when appropriate to a research effort. National security problems are often complex and understanding them requires appropriate analysis of data that suffer from methodological weaknesses including incompleteness, multi-collinearity, uncertainty, nonlinearity, non-normality, etc. Several NSI staff members have decades of experience with advanced statistical methodologies designed to meet these data challenges. They have applied these methodologies in academic (Kuznar 1991, 2003), proprietary commercial, and government settings. For example, advanced imputation methods were combined with statistical modeling to provide characterization of the types of groups and global regions where nuclear and biological agents were most likely to be smuggled by terrorists (Kuznar et al, 2009), the outputs of which were used to produce geo-spatial heat maps to assist USSOCOM to better plan where to focus assets. Recently developed methodologies for handling multi-collinear independent variables were applied for revealing driving factors to state fragility, terrorism, and irregular migration, the results of which produced global heat maps of use for long-range strategic campaign planning. Figure 4. NSI Stability Model - Nigeria 10 NSIRESEARCH ▪ INNOVATION ▪ EXCELLENCESocial Network Analysis Modeling Social and geospatial connections influence the flow of information, the capability of actors, and overall dynamics of the complex battlespace. NSI, along with USG partners (TRADOC) developed social network analysis models of the complex alliances and enmities between state and non-state actors in the Middle East that produced metrics to gauge regional stability and to measure the relative political power of states, their proxies, and jihadist organizations (Kuznar & Astorino-Courtois, 2017). This research produced findings to support U.S. efforts to defeat ISIS and mitigate Russian and Iranian influence in the Middle East, and could easily be adapted to research within the Proxy and Indirect Aggression gray zone research. Quantitative Discourse Analysis NSI discourse analysis is particularly appliable to the Communication & IO Research Thread. It uncovers the underlying attitudes, biases, behavioral intentions, sentiment, and cultural assumptions in leaders’ speeches, population chatter, community feedback, social media commentary, and other forms of digitized communications. NSI applies multiple linguistic and thematic analysis techniques, fueled by text analytic software, to capture structure, patterns, rhetoric, and culturally relevant themes in large, unstructured corpora of discourse. The resulting quantitative data are then used to gauge values, intent, and commitment of leaders and stakeholders and to test hypotheses regarding adversary intent and courses of action. When applied in a regional context, the discursive patterns of many actors have been used to construct the geo-spatial network of alliances while social network analysis has been employed to reveal levels of instability and key actors. Some recent applications included: Assessment of the strategic perspective of Bashar al Assad, the strategic and operational objectives of ISIS (Kuznar, 2017), Russian objectives in Eurasia, Russian and Chinese objectives in outer space, and North Korean Leadership Worldview, and post-summit assessments. NSI proposes to adapt these methodologies to gray zone use cases, and use them to develop methodologies for ongoing monitoring of related discourse, both social and geo-political. However, the rapidly changing nature of these communication themes will require development of adaptive models and application of multi-faceted social and behavioral science. Figure 5. NSI Middle East Network Model Figure 6. NSI Discourse Analysis Methodology 11 NSIRESEARCH ▪ INNOVATION ▪ EXCELLENCEAI/Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing (NLP) NSI uses artificial intelligence and machine learning for automatically identifying and categorizing interests from a variety of text-based sources. In the last iteration, significant progress was made in separating out auto-detected interests from a broad corpus without the need for extensive operator manipulation of data. Interest-Resolve-Capability (I-R-C) Regional Dynamics Analysis Methodology (NSI-developed) NSI developed its I-R-C analysis as a systematic method for exploring the complex, multi-actor, multi-interest relationships and dynamics that determine one or another regional future. It assesses these forces according to the confluences of three factors that condition state and/or non-state behaviors: 1) actors’ interests are the security, political, social, economic, and influence interests that an actor perceives to be at stake in a given context; 2) the actors’ relevant capability refers to the ability to directly influence or cause a particular outcome to occur; and, 3) actors’ resolve—the intent or willingness to do so. An I-R-C analysis produces a decision and interests analysis (see below), an empirical measure of resolve, and an assessment of each actors’ relative capabilities in relation to specific outcomes or events. The I-R-C methodology has been applied to the Levant and Gulf region, and the Western Pacific region. NSI proposes conducting research regarding adapting the I-R-C model to a variety of current and emerging gray zone dynamics, customized within geospatial contexts. Decision and Interest Analysis (NSI-developed) Issues that prompt decision calculations are comprised of three elements: 1) the options for action an actor believes he/she has; 2) the dimensions (concerns, interests) that determine preferences among those options; and 3) what each actor believes other relevant actors will do (i.e., the options and preferences attributed to others, in some cases including the state of nature (Astorino-Courtois, 1995, 2000, Bienenstock & Astorino-Courtois 2011). NSI has used its cognitive decision theory-based, subjective decision approach to create systematic “reconstructions” of interest-based (political, social, cultural, identity, international influence and prestige, and economic) decision calculi from the perspective of various actors of interest. The resulting analysis uncovers the range of possible “influence levers” for assuring an ally, or dissuading or deterring unacceptable activities by an opponent, as well as the strategies and influence points most likely to be most effective. This analytic technique has been applied in multiple studies and has produced well-researched and vetted individual “actor interest reports” including those on Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Syria. Further Explanation of Phase 3 Execution NSI also has developed and will leverage unique data collection techniques for testing its models against empirical data, including: Figure 7. NSI I-R-C Analysis 12 NSIRESEARCH ▪ INNOVATION ▪ EXCELLENCENSI’s Virtual Think Tank (ViTTa®) subject matter expert (SME) elicitation ViTTa efforts begin with pulsing an extensive list of vetted, US and international academic and think tank subject matter experts (SMEs) to generate data for other project needs (e.g., to support computational models, war games, etc.). In order preserve the raw data, NSI asks chosen SMEs to provide written submissions or, if preferred, NSI conducts a recorded 30-60-minute telephone interview. A ViTTa summary report or more in-depth Reachback Report may serve as an interim deliverable of the ongoing research project. Publications Repository For the same reasons, NSI has built an extensive, web-based repository of publications that provides a rich source of geospatial and analytic data. This repository includes over 200 government-sponsored research and analysis publications addressing a wide range of challenging national security problems and operational imperatives written between 2007 and the present. New research will, as appropriate, leverage data and conclusions from relevant past publications and reports. Automated data collection and updating NSI has extensive data science experience with automatically accessing “big data” sources, creating databases tailored to customer and government research needs, and updating these products. This capability will be essential to the proposed research to provide analysts and commanders the timely and accurate geospatial awareness they need for decision making. Further Explanation of Phase 4 Execution International relations, such as gray zone challenges, not only deals with complex systems of systems that shape human behaviors, it involves concepts and strategies for which it can be impossible to build prototypes that can be tested in the real world in real time. There are two reasons for this: 1) the act of researching or testing a particular subject’s behavior changes or adds error to an analysis; and 2) the costs in human lives, political opinion, safety, etc. of doing so are too dear. It is of course unreasonable and immoral to start a war in order to study specific aspects of wartime behavior. As a result, in the social sciences research presentations and peer-review of interim findings, novel concepts or new analytic approaches are a crucial tool in evaluating the scientific foundation, feasibility and practicality of research output. NSI has a number of means of disseminating research in order to elicit critical review from peer researchers as well as operators likely to be interested in, and use, the information produced. These include both written and oral presentation of key concepts and methodologies, in this case to the substantial SMA community of interests, including via: Publications NSI staff provide original research and expert contributions to government journals and white papers as well as peer-reviewed academic publications (e.g. Astorino-Courtois & Kuznar 2011). SMA White Papers Figure 8. NSI Virtual Think Tank (ViTTa) Process 13 NSIRESEARCH ▪ INNOVATION ▪ EXCELLENCEin particular provide valuable input into the research process by gathering different perspectives and efforts into a unified document, and providing feedback necessary for evaluating the validity and usefulness of NSI research efforts. The weekly SMA newsletter also features scholarly publications on topics of interest to the SMA community related to current research efforts. It shall be distributed worldwide to over 5000 members of the SMA community of interest, including DoD, whole of government, think tanks, academia, and foreign allies, in order to more effectively disseminate findings, share important research developments, and invite input. Speaker Sessions NSI vets the bona fides of distinguished scholars and practitioners to speak for the purpose of gaining awareness of the landscape of perspectives and research on key topics of interest. The purpose of the speaker series is to serve as an audio journal through which researchers and government personnel can tap into the collective knowledge base and engage in discussion and debate about on-going research and analyses among the federal inter-agency, universities, and others. NSI records and posts these events to a central repository accessible by other researchers, warfighters and reviewers. These sessions provide invaluable input and opportunities for discussion on a variety of gray zone related issues, thereby better informing the overall research process. Research Presentations at Research Symposium NSI makes presentations on research findings at a Joint Staff J39-hosted research symposium that addresses science and technology research and development related to national security threats and solutions. In addition, NSI identifies subject matter experts to make presentations, and suggests speaker topics in general. The symposium is attended by interested members of academia, government, and the private sector. It provides a unique marketplace for researchers and Combatant Commands to review and respond to research efforts that have produced interim or final results over the previous year. Participation in this two-day conference has risen steadily to reach over 300 attendees each year. This event is a helpful component of the evaluation of the scientific validity, reasonableness and instrumental value to end users of the proposed research. It will also provide NSI researchers with guides for anticipating future use cases, hypotheses, data requirements, and methodological developments needed to address emerging and undiscovered gray zone challenges. It should be noted that the Symposium is a no-fee event and thus there are no facility or other ODC costs associated with NSI’s presenting its research there (only minimal travel costs and time spent attending.) There are no expectations that government personnel will provide, or be assigned to provide, review. It is done as a social convention of the community of scholars. Government personnel participate in the conference and community review of research as their interest determines. In addition, given current uncertainty concerning the possibility of travel and larger meetings in the coming months, in the event that the Symposium is cancelled, NSI will lean more heavily on Publications and Speaker Sessions to conduct external, peer review and pulse expert reviewers via other modes of communication and review. 1.2.1 Research Outcomes and Associated Products There are two fundamental outcomes from the proposed multilevel, multimethod research efforts: 1) findings that refine understanding of gray zone concepts, challenges and possible US responses; and 2) creation and revision of analytic frameworks, tools and methodologies for conducting gray zone-specific analysis. The proposed NSI effort will expand the domain of scientific knowledge with regard to gray zone challenges. The expanded knowledge from all NSI research efforts will be captured in integration reports and reside in a government-owned archive. In addition, NSI puts its own and other analytic frameworks 14 NSIRESEARCH ▪ INNOVATION ▪ EXCELLENCEthrough a rigorous cycle of testing to uncover flaws and indicate improvements. The result is improved representations of the world, that in turn improve the accuracy of analyses. This has been a constant endeavor at NSI. All frameworks and methods will be subject to a critical evaluation and revised accordingly to improve the state-of-the-art of gray zone science. A number of concrete products are generated from these outcomes, including technical reports, multimedia presentations, and computational, machine learning and statistical models. 1.2.2 Research Coordination Research project management and support is essential for project success. Working with coordinating and integrating the work of multiple sub-teams that may use different research methods, different or sometimes shared databases, and across security domains is a daunting task. NSI shall synchronize and integrate the output of its own and other contributors’ research on gray zone efforts. Research management activities also include management of all security requirements for researcher access to government resources, meetings and protection of classified sources and information that may be accessed as part of a research project. In addition, NSI shall help assure the scientific validity and success of the research project with a weekly teleconference with other researchers. 1.3 Technical Program Summary As was just described, NSI shall produce a broad array of gray zone research in coordination with AGC and the SMA program. This can be summarized as follows: 1. Conduct Research and Analysis on Gray Zone Threads a. 4-Phase Research Design 2. Leverage and Refine Existing Analytic Methodologies for Gray Zone a. Stability and Instability Analysis b. Interest-Resolve-Capability (IRC) Regional Dynamics Analysis c. Decision and Interest Analysis 3. Employ Other Analytic Methods a. Quantitative Discourse Analysis b. Social Network Analysis c. AI/Machine Learning 4. Develop Additional Gray Zone-specific Methods and Supporting Processes a. Data Collection and Reporting Methodologies b. NSI’s Virtual Think Tank (ViTTa®) expert elicitation 5. Disseminate Preliminary and Final Research Reports for Peer and Community Review a. Publications Repository b. Reports and Presentations c. Speaker series events d. Weekly Newsletter e. Research Symposium 6. Manage the Internal Research Process a. Technical Coordination among Project Research Partners b. Security Coordination for Research Findings and Personnel 7. Monthly Progress Reports 15 NSIRESEARCH ▪ INNOVATION ▪ EXCELLENCE1.4 Risk Analysis and Alternatives Primary risks are those associated with integrating multiple analyses from a broad team using multifaceted analytical approaches and making them actionable for an end user such as a military planner, strategist, and/or decision-maker. To mitigate this risk, NSI utilized a formal integration stage within its various multi-method and multidisciplinary efforts in order to find consistencies, and resolve inconsistencies, across different work streams and disciplines. NSI shall implement a Quality Control Program (QCP) for this effort. Volume II describes the framework and processes within the QCP for delivering quality products and services required by the tasks in this effort. This quality control plan shall be provided to the Government within ten (10) days after contract award. NSI shall provide a briefing to the Government outlining the plan for implementation of the QCP for the contract tasks during the kick-off meeting. NSI shall ensure all work will be performed in accordance with the contract requirements and the quality control plan. NSI shall provide the requisite staffing and procedures to meet the quality, quantity, timeliness, responsiveness, customer satisfaction, and service delivery and performance requirements of this effort. NSI shall identify in the QCP, the applicable processes and metrics used to self-assess performance in addition to the resources to be applied to this effort. 1.5 References Astorino-Courtois, A., & Kuznar, L.

Our niche is helping clients better and more reliably understand people and their behaviors on critical, complex decision-making problems. Our capabilities are rooted in a highly diverse and experienced team of researchers and analysts applying multidisciplinary social science techniques and various analytic methods to create deeper analyses and clarifying insights enabling our clients to make more informed and better decisions. • Deeper Analyses: To create meaningful analyses one must move beyond asking “what happened” and instead ask “why it happened” and understand the conditions under which it might happen again. • Clarifying Insights: Data are abundant. Plots and graphs are easy. Insights are very hard. But when they are created, insights can be immensely powerful because they are actionable and create value for the client. • Better Decisions: Diversity provokes thought. Decades of research have shown that, for solving complex problems, diversity–a fundamental tenet of NSI–creates far better results than does homogeneity. 2.2 Capabilities and Relevant Experience Since its founding, NSI has worked on hundreds of projects for government and commercial clients. Our clients have become increasingly aware of the importance of accounting for the human component in their analytical and decision-making processes. However, many of their existing practices do not sufficiently accommodate such considerations. Helping clients understand people and their behaviors is precisely what we do. Below is a sample of NSI’s relevant experience. To see a much more expansive list, visit our website at www.nsiteam.com. Strategic Multi-Layer Assessment (SMA) SMA is a multi-disciplinary, multi-agency portfolio of projects that assess and study challenging “hard problems” associated with planning and operations of DoD, military services, and Government agencies. SMA projects involve intense yet finite study periods of six- to nine-months where proof-of-concept and prototype capabilities are developed and applied to overcome challenges. An extensive network of leading researchers and practitioners participate in SMA, spanning the DoD, intelligence community, the interagency, universities, industry, and national laboratories. SMA research is accepted, prioritized, and synchronized by the Joint Staff/J-39 DDGO and executed by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD (AT&L)) through the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Emerging Capability & Prototyping (DASD EC&P)/Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO). NSI has supported the Government in formulating, executing, and providing analyses for numerous SMA projects to date. In 2007, NSI coordinated modeling and analysis efforts for two projects: Sudan Strategic Assessment, which provided CENTCOM with an assessment of the Sudan and Horn of Africa by applying quantitative and computational social science models that addressed three concerns: (i) root causes of the humanitarian crisis, (ii) regional effects Sudan is having on the Horn of Africa, and (iii) conditions that are causing Sudan to become a safe haven for nefarious activity. In 2007 and 2009, NSI also designed coordinated two Deterrence projects, which focused on providing STRATCOM with a strategic deterrence framework (methodology) for 21st century state and non-state threats. These projects explored the utility 17 NSIRESEARCH ▪ INNOVATION ▪ EXCELLENCEof wargaming and modeling to improve the analytic foundation of strategic deterrence planning, identified elements of strategic deterrence aptly analyzed through wargaming and various sorts of modeling, and defined methods to apply wargaming and modeling to deterrence planning processes. In 2008, NSI led the modeling effort for the JIPOE (Joint Intelligence Preparation of the Operational Environment) project where SOCOM was provided with a detailed statistical analysis of two WMD-T case studies: one focused on nuclear smuggling in the Caucuses and Southern Asian region and the other focused on bio terrorism. In 2008-09, NSI led multiple aspects of the Inter-agency Limited Objective Experiment (IA LOE), which was focused on evaluating state-of-the-art modeling and analysis tools to help analysts anticipate rare events, measuring and demonstrating the value of collaborative processes, enabling tools and environments, and network architectures to find and characterize leading indicators of rare events. In 2009-10, NSI coordinated a major initiative for the ISAF Headquarters to provide the ISAF commander a rich contextual understanding of the Afghanistan/Pakistan region. Since then, NSI has supported SMA on projects ranging from nuclear non-proliferation on the Korean peninsula, the challenge of social unrest in emerging megacities, countering the emergent threat from ISIS, gray zone conflict from emerging near peers, and the challenges of competition in space, much of which has been cited in the above task descriptions. Socio-cultural Geo-informatics Lab (SGIL) In the Socio-cultural Geo-informatics Lab (SGIL) program, NSI built a state-of-the-art socio-cultural geo-informatics testbed to support assessment, test and evaluation (T&E), and transitioning of Human Social Culture Behavior Modeling (HSCB) technologies. In order to support OSD’s HSCB modeling initiative, NSI collaborated with Government, industry, FFRDCs, and academic partners to perform validation and applied research, early testing and transition of prototypes, maturing and hardening of testbed, T&E of HSCB models, and specification of metrics. During 2008, NSI built core infrastructure within the Army Geospatial Center’s Joint Geospatial Enterprise Services (JGES) facility, designed a socio-cultural data collection approach, and developed a GeoWiki as well as an agent-based civil unrest Thai software prototype in AnyLogic. During 2009, NSI provided test & assessment support for HSCB, helped to build sociocultural T&E and metrics framework, and designed basic structure for Technical Integration Experiments (TIEs). Mapping the Human Terrain (MAP-HT) The objective of the MAP-HT Joint Concept Technology Demonstration (JCTD) program was to develop, integrate, test, evaluate, and transition a socio-cultural toolkit to consolidate, visualize, and understand open source socio-cultural data to assist Commanders in understanding the “human terrain” in which they operate. The program sought to provide a relevant joint common picture of the socio-cultural human terrain for use by tactical elements, operational commanders, theater planners, interagency organizations, and coalition partners. The initial phase of MAP-HT contained early, accelerated transitions of various spirals of the socio-cultural toolkit to the Human Terrain System (HTS) program; the longer-term focus was on transitioning to DCGS-A/HDWS (Distributed Common Ground Station—Army/Human Domain WorkStation). The various sponsors and stakeholders included CENTCOM, Army Corps of Engineers Research and Development Center Topographic Engineering Center (ERDC-TEC), and DCGS-A. NSI served as a technical advisor to the program manager as well as provided a technology assessment of candidate technologies for various spirals of the socio-cultural toolkit. HumanGeo: Lazarus NSI staff worked as part of a multidisciplinary team to provide oversight of full analytical processes and technical performance evaluations of geospatial capabilities for the National Geospatial Intelligence 18 NSIRESEARCH ▪ INNOVATION ▪ EXCELLENCEAgency (NGA). In addition to oversight, NSI staff provided social science expertise to compliment geospatial and all source intelligence analysis. The analytical processes developed included question formation, hypothesis development, data gathering, and analysis. Technological development included assessment of the software necessary for analysis and ultimate visualization as data, to include static representations up to interactive dashboards for nominal end users. Technologies tested and assessed included GOTS and COTS tools of interest to NGA. NSI contributed to the evaluation, design, and workflow, and produced notional analytical products representative of intelligence products. NSI assisted in developing procedures for systematically incorporating unclassified research across classified domains. Key activities included review and evaluation of software, data gathering and research, final product delivery, and evaluation reports. Results were briefed to various stakeholders, including military operators, intelligence analysts, contractors, and NGA officials including the Director and Deputy-Director. Gray Zone Conflicts Challenges and Opportunities United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) requested a Strategic Multi-layer Assessment effort “to determine how the USG can identify, diagnose, and assess indirect strategies, and develop response options against associated types of gray zone conflicts.” This integration report provided a synthesis of all the team projects. Their work advanced understanding of the contours of the gray zone terrain, and the challenges inherent in navigating that terrain. By identifying the critical features of the gray zone, the findings also provided a guide to where USSOCOM and other DoD entities should focus future efforts in this area to facilitate the development of operational level planning and response strategies. The key results of the effort fall into four areas summarized as follows: • What is the nature of gray zone conflict? There is no single condition that can identify an action as gray, independent of actor or understanding of the broader strategic context. We need to think on multiple timescales, across multiple arenas (e.g., political, social, economic), and understand and engage with multiple social levels (state, group, individual). Populations are the key dimensions in gray zone conflict. Norm violations help define the threshold between ordinary competition and the gray zone. • What motivates actors to engage in gray zone activities? Successful US deterrence has not eliminated the motivations of other actors to further their own interests. Acting in the gray zone is an effective low risk, low cost strategy that has proven difficult for US and partner nations to counter and for vulnerable states to defend against. US military places primacy on physical maneuver, and our adversaries know this. • How should the US respond to gray zone activities? It should incorporate the human/cognitive domain: think and plan beyond kinetic responses alone; expand DoD definitions of maneuver and objective to account for the human aspects of military operations; and shape the international environment to reduce the motivations for engaging in gray zone activities. It should also develop a clear, compelling strategic narratives: provide alternative narratives and leverage social and mass media to communicate them; build trust and credibility with partner nations to enable unity of effort; and an enduring, proactive presence and consistent messaging across all USG agencies is a significantly superior approach to taking select actions in response to specific gray actions. Scope and timing of US response matters: Inaction in the face of low-level actions (e.g. Chinese Island building in the SCS) can over time create a “new reality” that threatens US interests and security, and early and effective response to gray actions and strategies requires a consistent US presence. • What capabilities does the US need to respond effectively to gray zone activities? Human/Cognitive Domain Information & Expertise–Gray zone strategies exploit multiple instruments of power. Operating in this environment requires information across all of these instruments. Conceptual 19 NSIRESEARCH ▪ INNOVATION ▪ EXCELLENCEModels and Frameworks–The scope of gray zone activities will make information requirements overwhelming without models to guide search and interpretation. 2.3 Previous or Current Relevant Independent Research and Development (IR&D) Work This proposal has not been submitted to any other agency. NSI is currently engaged in an internal research and development project to develop machine learning and artificial intelligence automated algorithms to identify, code, and classify “interests” of state and non-state actors. The intent is to develop a capability to quickly find and help to facilitate leveraging of critical information in a rapid and comprehensive fashion, without the need for extensive manual searching of relevant material. Initial progress is very encouraging, with a stable separation of interest and non-interest coding of documents in the training data set. 2.4 Related Government Contracts A sample of POC’s for past performance is provided below.

The majority of our staff work out of home offices in close proximity to key clients spanning the US (MA, VA, NC, CA, IN, PA, CO, TX, IL, WA). NSI has invested significantly in state-of-art information technology (IT) capabilities and enjoys a highly efficient distributed collaborative work environment across locations of our current staff. All NSI personnel maintain home offices that include high-end laptops; servers (at a few locations); high speed broadband network access; 4x1 photocopier, scanner, fax and printer; cell phone; and a range of standard desktop and custom software. NSI staff use collaborative work techniques every day, such as audio teleconferencing; centralized voice mail; shared MS Exchange server; shared files, schedules and tasks via SharePoint; and collaboration software such as Skype, NetMeeting/Meeting Space, and Groove. Standard NSI documents are generated using Microsoft Office applications. NSI has an automated job-cost 20 NSIRESEARCH ▪ INNOVATION ▪ EXCELLENCEaccounting system (QuickBooks Premier 2011) and time keeping system (Replicon) specifically designed to comply with DCAA requirements. NSI staff participate in annual data security training at our yearly company off-site. 2.6 Data Rights NSI will not be delivering any technical data or computer software with other than the usual unlimited use rights in accordance with DFARS 252-227-7013. NSI shall not be obligated to deliver any use rights or technical data to other contractors that might be working on similar government projects. 3.1 Schedule for the Research Effort NSI will conduct three gray zone research projects during the contract base period, three during the two-year Option 1, and two slightly shorter projects during the twelve-month Option 2. In order to accommodate two projects in Option year 2, NSI will select topics of study that are shorter in nature and that will last approximately 6 months each. Each of the proposed projects will address one or more of the four Research Threads of NSI’s proposed Gray Zone Research Program. NSI will assure that each Thread is addressed at least once over the course of the 60-month contract period, and will make every effort at the design stage to incorporate more than one Thread per project. At the project overview level, each of what will amount to approximately seven research projects will be structured in accordance with NSI’s four-phase approach, and will include: • a 1-2 month problem definition phase to clearly specify the research question, identify key constructs, and define the problem scope (Phase I) • a 1-2 month research design phase including development of a fully-specified analytic frame, definition of concepts, operationalized definition of research variables and the choice of analytical method (Phase 2) • a 3-8 month hypothesis testing, data collection and analysis phase (Phase 3) Figure 9. Proposed GZ Research Timeline 21 NSIRESEARCH ▪ INNOVATION ▪ EXCELLENCE• and, and a 1-3 month phase for initial dissemination and peer review (Phase 4). Given the nature of the external review-revision-review process during Phase 4, the final integrated reports will have gone through multiple drafts. To avoid external reviewers holding up timely delivery of the final products to the government, NSI will release, as a proven best practice, findings from completed project sub tasks prior to the final review period. A Note on Why NSI Projects are so Complex The basis of NSI’s analytic philosophy, and our approach to wickedly complex problems such as gray zone challenges, is what we call “triangulation.” The concept of triangulating input to gain a more accurate perspective on a single point guides how we design and execute research projects (i.e., Phases 2 and 3). Specifically, we design our projects to combine input from multiple individual efforts, or sub-tasks, (usually, between five and twelve per single project.) These sub-tasks use multiple data sources and types of quantitative, qualitative and computational analyses to a single question or topic. For example, in the project shown in Figure 10, we engaged three different types of polling which provided data input for eight different types of analysis. Figure 11 shows the flowchart for a different project. While NSI’s analytic philosophy certainly adds complexity and breadth to our projects, looking at a problem from multiple angles provides the analytic rigor that makes our research findings both nuanced and robust. In addition, Phase 4 peer review is not limited to the final integrated project report. Individual sub-tasks report their own conclusions, and these are exposed to review by academics, interested members of the community of practitioners and others in the same ways that the integrated project reports are. For this reason, a typical “single” project will produce multiple reports of sub-task results as well as a single, vetted integration report that pulls the main narrative from the various sub-task reports. It is important to note that Integrating multiple research outputs does not mean finding the ‘least common denominator’ or forcing agreement: If sub-tasks produce different views this is reported (and further research is conducted to understand the source of the difference. Consensus views are held to a stricter standard. 3.2 Time Line Chart by Task For all projects as part of this effort, NSI shall follow a task deliverable schedule consistent with the table below. All deliverables become the property of the United States Government. Unless otherwise stated, Figure 10. Triangulated Sub-task Efforts on 2017 Afghanistan Project Figure 11.

It results from the interplay of a staggering array of social, economic, and political factors, as well as changing physical and technological landscapes. USAFRICOM must be able to operate effectively in the environment that includes serious challenges wrought by the effects of climate change. The physical effects of global climate change include rapidly rising ground temperatures, devastating rises on sea levels and ocean temperatures, increased heavy precipitation (heavy rain and hail) and desertiﬁcation. However, the cascading effects of cli mate changes on human political, social, and economic security can be wide -ranging and extreme. In Africa these highly interdependent effects are already increasing the likelihood of complex security challenges: • Rising seas increase the salinity of ground water which can create food insecurity • Food insecurity and famine make populations more vulnerable to malign actors, and likely to migrate away from homes that have become unlivable • Large population migrations can stress infrastructure and services, and foment political and social instability in urban areas • Political and social tensions challenge weak and still -developing governing institutions and security sectors, increasing state fragility and instability that can easily bleed over from one country to another. Factor Four: Project Experience Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal. National Security Innovations, Inc. Proprietary Information Alone, each of these concerns impacts the ability of the US to achieve national goals in Africa. Taken together they present an operating picture that may seem nearly intractable. Complete and accurate analyses of this context requires that the system -of-systems that these and other factors create is accounted for. (1) Detailed description of SIN relevant work performed and results achieved The proposed effort extends the work completed in AFOE phases I and II. It addresses the requirement by a) continu ing SMA analytic reach -back support of USAFRICOM decision -makers, planners and assessors demonstrated by the AFOE project, b) reﬁning the model to extend the scope of AECM to include climate and climate change impacts and improve its usefulness an analytic tool; and, c) providing training on the mindset and processes that will aid AFRICOM analysts in using the AECM most effectively . The task ar eas described below will be prioritized and relative levels -of-effort established following consultation with USAFRICOM. TASK 1: Analytic Reach- back Support . Reach -back support includes: • Quick Looks: Quick Look reports will be prepared on AECM sub -systems around nodes and topics as requested by or in consultation with USAFRICOM. • On request Consultation: The team will be available for additional consultation on model insights, data availability and other issues of concern relating to the AECM. TASK 2: AECM Reﬁnement: AECM reﬁnement consists of several tasks intended to increase the robustness of the model as well as its functionality for issues of greatest interest to USAFRICOM. These include: • Node & Sub -system Research . Owing to the period of performance of the AFOE effort, there are nodes and edges in the AECM that require additional node deﬁnition and exploration of edge relationships to increase conﬁdence in model validity especially on topics of particular concern to the Command like governing stability, and climate change. This sub -task may also include adding nodes or system modules (e.g., US -China competition) into the model. • Logic model Build -out. At present the AECM model is represented in an adjacency matrix that shows direct and cascades of indirect relationships between nodes. It does not however capture dependent or contingent relationships. The logic model allows experimentation to explore sy stem effects of perturbations with varied initial conditions. • AECM State -Level. Tailor AECM for regional, state -level, or sub -state levels, or to topics of interest topics (e.g., terrorism), with or without additional Quick Looks . TASK 3: Training . At the Government’s request, GECM/AECM training will include in -person, on - line, or hybrid four -day courses to provide AFRICOM users with an introduction to analytic and systems thinking via the GECM and AECM system -of-systems including how these models are created, what kinds of questions the model is suited to explore, and the limitations of this powerful method. The course may also include how to create Quick Looks and the use of data resources speciﬁc to the African continent. Training task activities will include course preparation, creation of course materials, and course delivery.

In addition, NSI complies with applicable state and local la ws governing nondiscrimination in employment in every location in which it has facilities. This polic y applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including, but not limited to, hiring, placement, promotion, termination, layoff, recall, transfer, le aves of absence, compensation and training . AAMMEERRIICCAANNSS WWIITTHH DDIISSAABBIILLIITTIIEESS AACCTT PPOOLLIICCYY The Americans wit h Disabilities Act (ADA) requires an employer to provide reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities, unless it would cause undue hardship. A reasonable accommodation is any change in the work environment or in the way a job is performed th at enables a person with a disability to enjoy equal employment opportunities. If you require an accommodation you must inform your supervisor that there is a need for an adjustment or change at work for a reason related to a medical condition. We will respond promptly and to the best of our ability to accommodate the needs of all employees . CCLLAASSSSIIFFIICCAATTIIOONNSS OOFF EEMMPPLLOOYYMMEENNTT PPOOLLIICCYY For purposes of salary admin istration and eligibility for overtime payments and employment benefits, NSI classifies its employees as follows: − Full-time Regular: Employees hired to work NSI’s normal, full time, 30 hour or more workweek on a regular basis. Such employees may be “ exemp t” or “non -exempt” as defined below. − Part-time Regular: Employees hired to work fewer than 30 hours p er week on a regular basis. Such employees may be “exempt” or “non -exempt” as defined below. − Temporary: Employees engaged to work full time or part time on NSI’s payroll with the understanding that their employment will be terminated no later than upon com pletion of a specific assignment. (Note that a temporary employee may be offered, and may accept, a new temporary assignment with NSI and thus still retain temporary status.) Such employees may be “exempt” or “non-exempt” as defined below. (Note that emplo yees hired from temporary employment agencies for specific assignments are employees of the respective agency and not of NSI.) − Non-exempt: Employees who ar e required to be paid minimum wage and overtime at the federal or state prescribed wage rate, whichev er is higher. − Exempt: Employees who are not required to be paid minimum wage and overtime, in accordance with applicable federal wage and hour laws, for wo rk performed beyond forty hours in a workweek. Executives, professional employees, outside sales repr esentatives, certain computer programmers and employees in some administrative positions are typically exempt. OOUUTTSSIIDDEE EEMMPPLLOOYYMMEENNTT PPOOLLIICCYY Employees may not hold outside jobs or do freelance consulting work for NSI’s customers or competitors under any circu mstance, unless it is pre -approved by the NSI CEO or President beforehand, and provided the employee continues to meet the performance standards of their j ob with NSI. If an employee does hold any outside job, he will be judged by the same performance stan dards and will be subject to scheduling demands, regardless of any existing outside work requirements. NSI, Inc. Policies and Procedures Page 6 of 74 www.NSIteam .com If it is determined that an employee’s outside work conflicts or interferes with performance, safety or the ability to meet the requirements of NSI as they are modified from time to time, the employee may be asked to terminate the outside employment if he desires to remain with NSI . Outside employment tha t constitutes a conflict of interest is prohibited. Employees also may not receive any income or material gain from individuals outside NSI for materials produced or services rendered while performing their jobs with NSI and/or pursuant to restrictions tha t may apply on certain US Government or other customer contracts . EEMMPPLLOOYYMMEENNTT OOFF RREELLAATTIIVVEESS PPOOLLIICCYY NSI permits the employment of qualified relatives of employees so long as such employment does not, in the opinion of NSI, create actual or perceived conflict s of interest. For purposes of this policy, “relative” is defined as a spouse, child, parent, sibling , grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, first cousin, or corresponding in-law or “step” relation. NSI will exercise sound business judgment in the placemen t of related employees in accordance with the following guidelines: − Individuals who are related by b lood or marriage are permitted to work in the same facility provided no direct reporting or supervisory/management relationship exists. That is, no employe e is permitted to work within the “ chain of command ” of a relative such that one relative's work responsibilities, salary, or career progress could be influenced by the other relative. − No relatives are permitted to work in the same department or in any oth er positions in which NSI believes an inherent conflict of interest may exist. This policy applies t o all categories of employment at NSI, including regular, temporary and part -time classifications . AADDVVAANNCCEEMMEENNTT AANNDD PPRROOMMOOTTIIOONN PPOOLLIICCYY NSI’s preference is to promote employees from within the current workforce whenever possible. Once a vacancy is established , you may apply for the job provided you are qualified for such advancement. In making advancement to a new position, the demonstrated ability and overall qualifications of the applicant will be considered. The final decision on applicants will be based upon the overall qualification of the applicant . SSEEPPAARRAATTIIOONN FFRROOMM EEMMPPLLOOYYMMEENNTT PPOOLLIICCYY An employee may be separated from employment voluntarily or involuntarily by retirement, resignation, lack of work, or termination. Resignation Any employee who voluntarily resigns is expected to provide NSI with advance written notice of no less than two weeks as is customarily done as a business courtesy. Failure to provide such notice may result in the employee not being eligible for rehire. If an employee has accrued and earned but unused vacation time upon termination of employment, see Policy No. 1 8 for applicable policies regarding payment for accrued but unused vacation time. Layoff Due to Lack of Work NSI attempts to maintain a stable work force, however, business co nditions sometimes change to a point that there is not enough work to keep all employees on the payroll. Should such a situation occur the work force may b e reduced through layoffs . Layoffs will be determined by the ability of the affected employees to adequately perform the available work with a minimum of retraining. Length of service and non -medically related absences may also be considered where relative ability is equal. Exit Interviews Management may decide to conduct, or the employee leaving may req uest an exit interview to discuss your reasons for leaving and any other impressions that you may have about NSI. During the exit interview, you can provide insights into areas for improvement for NSI and your specific position. NSI, Inc. Policies and Procedures Page 7 of 74 www.NSIteam .com Return of NSI Property Any NSI property issued to you or paid for by NSI , such as software, computer equipment, blackberries, databases, files, pager, printers, scanners, photocopie rs, fax machines, office furniture, keys, parking passes or corporate credit card must be returned at the time of your termination. You will be responsible for any lost or damaged items. The value of any property issued and not returned may be deducted fro m your final paycheck, and you may be required to sign a wage deduction authorization form for this p urpose . NSI, Inc.

Harassment, even when not unlawful or directed at a protected category, is expressly prohibited and will not be tolerated. Accordingly, NSI management is committed to vigorous ly addressing complaints of harassment and sexual harassment at all levels. Reported or suspected occurrences of harassment will be promptly and thoroughl y investigated. Following an investigation, NSI will immediately take any necessary and appropriate d isciplinary action. NSI will not permit or condone any acts of retaliation against anyone who files harassment complaints or cooperates in the investigati on of same. 1. The term “harassment ” includes harassment based on any category protected by federal, st ate, or local law, which may include depending on the jurisdiction, but is not limited to, unwelcome slurs, jokes, or verbal, graphic or physical conduct r elating to an individual's race, color, religious creed, sex, national origin, ancestry, citizenship status, pregnancy, physical disability, mental disability, age, military status or status as a Vietnam -era or special disabled veteran, marital status, registered domestic partner or civil union status, gender (including sex stereotyping and gender identit y or expression), medical condition (including, but not limited to, cancer related or HIV/AIDS related) or sexual orientation . 2. Sexual harassment consists o f unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sex ual nature where : a. Submission to such conduct is an explicit or implicit term or condition of employment ; b. Employment decisions are based on an employee's su bmission to or rejection of such conduct; or c. Such conduct interferes with an individual's work perfor mance or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment . Complaint Procedure NSI provides its employees with a convenient and reliable method for reporting incidents of harassment, including sexual harassment. Any employee who feels har assed or discriminated against is encouraged to immediately inform the alleged harasser that the behavior is unwelcome. In many instances, the person is unaware that their conduct is offensive and when so advised can easily and willingly correct the conduc t so that it does not reoccur. If the informal discussion with the alleged harasser is unsuccessful in remedying the problem, or if you do not feel comfort able with such an approach, you should immediately report the conduct to your immediate supervisor . Additionally, you should submit a written report of the problem to the head of Human Resources. We cannot help resolve a harassment problem unless we know a bout it. Therefore, it is your responsibility to bring those kinds of problems to our attention so th at we can take the necessary steps to correct the problem. The written report to the head of Human Resources should include all facts available to the empl oyee regarding the harassment or sexual harassment . Confidentiality All reports of harassment or sex ual harassment will be treated seriously. However, absolute confidentiality is not promised nor can it be assured. NSI will conduct an investigation of any complaint of harassment or sexual harassment, which may require limited disclosure of pertinent info rmation to certain parties, including the alleged harasser. Investigative Procedure NSI, Inc. Policies and Procedures Page 9 of 74 www.NSIteam .com Once a complaint of harassment or sexual harassment is received, NSI will begin a prompt and thorough investigation. The investigation may include interviews with all invo lved employees, including the alleged harasser, and any employees who are aware of facts or incidents alleged to have occurred. Following an investigation , NSI will immediately take any necessary and appropriate disciplinary action. Disciplinary action will be taken if the investigation reveals that an employee has acted in a manner that is not in alignment with the goal of this policy, even when the action s may be lawful. In fact, NSI may address any workplace issue discovered during an investigation. This may include some or all of the following steps: 1. Restore any lost terms, conditions or benefits of employment to the complaining employee. 2. Discipline the harasser. This discipline can include written disciplinary warnings, transfer, demotion, suspension, and termination . If the harassment or sexual harassment is from a vendor or customer the first step you should take is to notify NSI in writing. Submit the written report to the head of Human Resources. NSI will take appropriate action notify the vendor /customer of the situation and work with them to stop the conduct. As a result of NSI intervention, the vendor or customer may need to open an investigatio n of its own. Whenever an outside organization wants to interview your or attempts to obtain any deta ils from you regarding harassment that has happened in the workplace, a representative from NSI’s Human Resources must be present. Duties of Employees and Supervisors All employees of NSI , both management and non- management, are responsible for assuring t hat a workplace free of harassment or sexual harassment is maintained. Any employee may file a harassment complaint regarding incidents experienced persona lly or incidents observed in the workplace. NSI strives to maintain a lawful, pleasant work environme nt where all employees are able to effectively perform their work without interference of any type and requests the assistance of all employees in this effort. All NSI supervisors and managers are expected to adhere to the anti -harassment policy. Supervis ors' evaluations may include an assessment of the supervisor's efforts in following and enforcing this policy. All managers and supervisors are responsibl e for doing all they can to prevent and discourage harassment or sexual harassment from occurring. If a complaint of harassment or sexual harassment is raised, supervisors and managers are to act promptly and notify NSI Executive staff to proceed with an i nvestigation. If a supervisor or manager fails to follow this policy, he or she will be disciplined. Such discipline may include termination . GGUUIIDDEELLIINNEESS FFOORR AAPPPPRROOPPRRIIAATTEE CCOONNDDUUCCTT NSI employees are expected to accept certain responsibilities, follow acceptab le business principles in matters of conduct, and exhibit a high degree of integrity and ethical cond uct at all times. This not only involves sincere respect for the rights and feelings of others, but also demands that employees refrain from any behavior t hat might be harmful to themselves, co -workers, the company, or that might be viewed unfavorably by c urrent or potential customers or by the public at large. Employee conduct reflects on NSI. Employees are, consequently, encouraged to observe the highest s tandards of professionalism at all times. Types of behavior and conduct that NSI considers inappropr iate include, but are not limited to, the following: − Falsifying employment or other NSI records; − Violating NSI’s anti- harassment policy; − Soliciting or acc epting gratuities from customers or clients; Excessive absenteeism or tardiness; − Excessive, unnece ssary, or unauthorized use of NSI property and supplies, particularly for personal purposes; − Reporting to work under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and the illegal manufacture, possession, use, sale, distribution or transportation of drugs; NSI, Inc. Policies and Procedures Page 10 of 74 www.NSIteam .com − Unauthorize d use of alcoholic beverages on NSI property or using alcoholic beverages while engaged in NSI business off the company's premises, except where authorized ; − Fighting or using obscene, abusive, or threatening language or gestures; − Theft of property from co -workers, customers, or the company; − Unauthorized possession of firearms on NSI premises or while on NSI business; − Disregarding safety or security regulatio ns especially as regards classified materials and locations; and − Failing to maintain the confidentiality of NSI, customer, or client information. Should an employee’s performance, work habits, overall attitude, conduct or demeanor become unsatisfactory ba sed on violations either of the above or of any other NSI policies, rules, or regulations, the employ ee will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Other behaviors resulting in a US Government security censure on NSI, and/or th e loss of your security clearances, whether intentional or inadvertent, may result in immediate termination. Before or during imposition of any discipline, employees will be given an opportunity to relate their version of the incident or problem at issue and provide any explanation or justification they consider relevant. Where appropriate, a policy of progressive employee redirection will be followed by supervisors. Major elements of this policy include: − Verbal Reprimand . The first step in NSI’s policy is the “verbal reprimand.” This is a verbal warning to an employee that his conduct is unacceptable, and that repeated or continued failure to conform his conduct or performance to NSI standards will result in more severe action. Before receiving a verbal reprimand, an employee will be counseled by his supervisor and told what improvements are necessary a nd expected to correct any performance deficiencies. A record of the notice of the verbal reprimand shall be made and retained in the employee's personnel file. − Written Reprimand . The second step is a “written reprimand.” This reprimand will describe the unacceptable conduct or performance of the employee and specify needed changes or improvements. A copy of the written reprimand will be retained in the empl oyee's personnel file. − Termination . The final step in the disciplinary procedure is the termination o f the employee. If an employee fails to modify his conduct or performance to conform to the standards required by NSI, the company may, in its sole discret ion, terminate the employee's employment. Notwithstanding this policy, NSI reserves the right to red irect employees in such a manner as it deems appropriate to the circumstances, and may, in its sole discretion, eliminate any or all of the steps in the discipline process.

Care of an employee’s spouse, child, or parent (“family member”) who has a serious health condition; or 4. Employee’s serious health condition which prevents the employee from performing any one essential function of the empl oyee’s position. A serious health condition is an illness, injury, impairment or physical or mental condition that involves either inpatient care or continuing treatment by a health care provider. Eligible Employee An active full -time or part -time employ ee is eligible for NSI Family and Medical Leave (NFML) in compliance with The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 (“ the Act”) provided that on the date the employee requests leave: 1. He/she has been actively employed by NSI full -time for at least 4 months; or 2. He/she has been actively employed by NSI part -time for at least 12 months. Length of Leave In accordance with th e FMLA, an eligible employee is entitled to a total of 12 workweeks of unpaid leave within a 12- month period. The amount of leave av ailable to an employee will be calculated by looking backward at the amount of leave taken within the 12 -month period immedi ately preceding the first date of leave. Leave taken for the care of a newborn child or placement for adoption or foster care must b e taken as an uninterrupted, continuous leave of absence and must be taken within 12 months of the birth or placement of the child. If both a husband and wife are employed by NSI and are eligible for leave, except for leave due to the employee’s serious health condition, the two may take a combined total of 12 -weeks. Intermittent leave or a reduced schedule may be approved for the employee’s serious health condition or a family member’s serious health condition where medically necessary and where the need for such leave is best accommodated through such scheduling. An employee requesting intermittent leave/reduced schedule may b e transferred temporarily to an available alternative position with equivalent pay and benefits, or to a part -time position if such a position better accommodates the need for intermittent leave/reduced schedule. NSI Family and Medical Leave Eligible employees are also entitled to 10 days of paid NSI Family and Medical Leave (NFML) on a 12 month rolling calendar to be used in the case of: 1. Birth of an employee’s child or to care for the newborn child; 2. Placement of a child with the employee for adoption or state -approved foster care; 3. Care of an employee’s spouse, child, or parent (“family member”) who has a serious health condition; 4. Employee’s serious health condition which prevents the employee from performing any one essential function of the employee’s po sition; or 5. Bereavement in the case of the death of an employee’s family member. A serious health condition is an illness, injury, impairment or physical or mental condition that involves either inpatient care or continuing treatment by a health care provi der. NSI, Inc. Policies and Procedures Page 15 of 74 www.NSIteam .com Substitution of Paid Leave An employee taking FMLA family and medical leave due to the employee’s serious health condition mus t substitute all accrued NFML family and medical leave before continuing leave on an unpaid basis. An employee taking leave for reasons other than an employee’s own serious health condition must exhaust all accrued NFML family and medical leave before cont inuing leave on an unpaid basis. Any family and medical leave, whether paid, unpaid, or a combination thereof, will be count ed toward the 12 -week leave entitlement. Employee Notification Requirements If an employee expects to take FMLA family and medical leave, the employee must notify their supervisor and NSI’s HR Coordinator of the intention to take leave at least 30 days in advance of the expected leave. Following proper notification, the employee must complete a Leave of Absence Request form and provid e any required medical certification. If the need for leave is not foreseeable, the employee must provide notification of l eave to their supervisor as soon as is practicable under the circumstances. An employee’s failure to provide 30 days advance notific ation for foreseeable leave may result in a delay of leave. Medical Certification An employee who takes leave for the emplo yee’s serious health condition or to care for a family member with a serious health condition must submit to NSI’s HR Coordinator written medical certification of the need for such leave from the applicable health care provider. Failure to provide the cert ification in a timely manner may result in a delay of leave. The health care provider may request a second or third medical opinion for verification of an employee’s serious health condition. The opinion of the third health care provider shall be final and binding on the employee. In addition, while the employee is on leave, the health care provider may require the employee to provide periodic recertification of the employee’s medical condition (not to exceed once every 30 days) and may inquire as to the em ployee’s intentions to return to work. An employee on uninterrupted, continuous leave due to the employee’s own serious health cond ition will be required to provide a job -related medical certification of fitness before the employee is allowed to return to work. Failure to provide this certification may result in the delay or denial of job restoration. Benefits Continuation The same h ealth care benefits coverage provided to an employee on the day prior to taking FMLA family and medical leave will be mainta ined during any NFML or vacation leave taken plus up to the 12- weeks or as required by law, provided the employee continues to pay a ny required contribution for benefits. Employees who are on leave are responsible for making their periodic payment of the r equired contribution. Upon completion of the FMLA family or medical leave, or if an employee fails to return to work at the end of the leave, a loss of coverage will occur, and continuation of health care coverage would be offered through COBRA. An employ ee who does not return from leave may be required, under certain circumstances provided by the Act, to reimburse NSI for any employee contributions paid by NSI while the employee was on unpaid leave. While on leave, an employee must continue to pay the em ployee’s contributions or loan payments for any applicable benefits which would otherwise be automatically deducted from the employee’s wages (e.g., supplemental lif e insurance, credit union loans and 401(k) loans). Contact NSI’s HR Coordinator and/or CPS for details regarding employee contributions and/or loan payments. The period of time an employee is on FMLA and/or NFML family and medical leave will be treated as continued service for purposes of vesting and eligibility to participate under any availab le pension or retirement plan. Absences due to leave will not be counted as time worked for the purpose of s eniority or computing va cation or sick/personal leave. Job Restoration NSI, Inc. Policies and Procedures Page 16 of 74 www.NSIteam .com An employee will be returned to the same or an equivalent position when the employee returns from FMLA and/or NFML family and medical leave, with no loss of benefits accrued prior to leave. An employee who does not return to work at the end of an authorized leave is subject to termination of employment. In the event an employee’s position with NSI is affected by a decision or event not related to the employee’s leave of absence, e.g., job elimination due to a reduction in force, the employee will be affected to the same extent as if he was not on leave. Certain “key employees ” as defined under The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 may not be eligible to be restored to the same or an equivalent position after leave if doing so would cause substantial and grievous economic injury to the operations of NSI . NSI will notify such employees of their “key employee” status and the conditions under which job restoration will be denied, if applicable. Workers' Compensation and Family and Medical Leave With some exceptions, an absence related to a workers' compensation injury is not counted against an employee's FMLA family and medical leave entitlement. If an employee who was injured on the job and as a result who suff ered a “ serious health condition ” declines the offer of a medically -approved “light duty ” position, the employee must notify NSI’s HR Coordinator that he chooses to exercise his FMLA family and medical leave rights, if he is so eligible. If the employee ac cepts the “light duty ” position in lieu of any FMLA family and medical leave or returns to work within 12 weeks after the da te of the injury, the employee will retain his right to be restored to the same or an equivalent position until 12 weeks have passed unless a decision or event not related to the employee's leave of absence occurs which results in the termination of the em ployee or the elimination of the job position.

Your lodging p er diem will be based on this city. − Departure Time refers to the time when your travel began, for example, either from your home or the office. It does not mean the time of your flight. − Return Time refers to the time when yo ur travel ended. This means time when you arrived home or to the office or other place of business.

If you are conducting busi ness development, state it such that an auditor would know and with whom the business development efforts were conducted. − Lodging Pe r Diem – Employees will be reimbursed based on the government approved per diem rates for the destination city. Please go to the official per diem website. − NOTE : Meal and Incidental per diem rates are listed separately on the website and should be combined on the “M&IE Per Diem” line on the Travel Expense Report form. If needing to adjust the “M&IE” amounts for meals covered by NSI, please refer to the GSA per diem site http://www.gsa.gov/portal/catego ry/21287 .

If the employee’s actual ho tel rate is higher than the per diem rate, the employee will only be reimbursed for the excess amount if approved by NSI’s CE O. If not approved, the employee will be reimbursed at the government per diem rate and, in addition, the hotel tax will be reduced to the amount that would have been charged at per diem.

Employees who have worked a partial year will have their bonus potential pro -rated based on the amount of time worked at NSI. The extent to which bonuses are accrued is at the sole discretion of the BOD and the amount of funding released to pay -out bonus awards is the function of how well NSI meets its designated Fiscal Objectives as well as NSI employees achieving their individual objectives . Bonuses are not guaranteed entitlements and NSI may decide to rescind, retract, modify, amend, or terminate this policy, in whole or in part at any time, for any reason whatsoever b y majority vote of its BOD . DDEEFFIINNIITTIIOONNSS Annual Bonus Plan The Annual Bonus Plan is an employee incentive program designed to advanc e the interests of both the employer and employee by making the achievement of certain objectives and delivery of superior q uality performance reciprocally beneficial to both. The Bonus Plan year is the calendar year that is also NSI’s fiscal year. Bonus Accrual Rate A bonus accrual rate is selected each year for purposes of establishing the annual Overhead budget. It is stated in terms of percentage of payroll. The BOD sets this accrual rate when they accept the annual budget. The chief reason for predetermining an accrual rate is to make sure adequate funds are set aside on an accrual basis to actually pay out bonus. This acc rual rate is set for budgetary purposes and Executive Management may revise it with the BOD’s approval during the year, if circumsta nces warrant such revision. An accrual rate is typically set, or revised, based on existing or predicted economic conditions for the year. For example, Executive Management may adjust the accrual rate upward if it believes there is a strong likelihood that NSI will materially exceed its Fiscal Objectives . Operational Fiscal Objectives Fiscal Objectives are annual goals develop ed by Executive M anagement and accepted by the BOD . The Fiscal Objectives may vary from year to year based on the tactical and strat egic needs of NSI . The meeting of these NSI, Inc. Policies and Procedures Page 44 of 74 www.NSIteam .com goals typically has a direct bearing on NSI ’s ability to fund the bonus pool. Execut ive Management may revise Fiscal Objectives with the BOD’s approval during the year, if circumstances warrant such revision. Total Funded Bonus Pool This amount is computed based on the 1) Bonus Accrual Amount and 2) percent achievement of specified fiscal goals. This amount represents the maximum potential amount of bonus dollars that could be given out in any given year under the pl an. Bonus Awards to Employees Eligible employees who participate in bonus awards are those who have delivered performance that meets or exceeds the normal expectations and requirements for their positions, thereby resulting in the delivery of superior tec hnical, fiscal, and/or managerial quality. No bonus awards will be made to persons not meeting the expectations of their pos ition. All employees who meet the expectation s of their job position s are eligible to receive a bonus, though it is expected that th e majority of the bonus pool will be distributed to those persons exceeding the expectations and requirements for their posi tions. Performance evaluations will be conducted in accordance with NSI’s Performance Review Policy. For each employee, Executive Ma nagement shall review and concur with their overall performance rating before it is given to the employee. Overall Rating D efinition Exceptional: Employee always gets results far beyond what is required. Exceeds Requirements : Employee goes above and beyo nd expectations. Meets Requirements: Employee meets basic requirements. Tasks are completed on time. Marginal: Employee needs improvement in quality of work. Completes tasks, but not on time. Unsatisfactory: Employee d oes not perform required tasks. Req uires constant supervision . PPRROOCCEEDDUURREE General In December, Executive Management will set fiscal and/or operational goals f or the next fiscal year. Likewise, in December, or at the start of an employee’s employment, certain goals will be set that are coup led to corporate goals. Additionally, employees will be expected to perform at, or above, professional expectations in the position for which they were hired. Adoption of Bonus and Fiscal Objectives NSI’s Bonus and Fiscal Objectives will be set forth in t he Annual Budget prepared for the Board of Directors’ review and approval. Fiscal objectives will be disclosed to employees by their Manager. Each employee will have their annual objectives communicated to them in December by their Manager. Determination of Pool Funding After November is closed, Executive M anagement will calculate the expected amount of bonus dollars for the next fiscal year based on the projected year’s payroll and the expected percentage achievement of fiscal goals. This calculation will determine the bonus pool amount for the year . Determination of Participation All managers will complete “draft” Performanc e Reviews for their employees in accordance with NSI ’s Performance Review process , no later than December 1 of the year. The Perform ance Review will include an assessment of achievement of any specific annual objectives set for them. The Draft reviews will be forwarded by Managers to Executive Management for review. After their review, Executive Management will provide feedback by the end of the second week of December . Final Performance Reviews will be completed by the end of the third week of December .

SSCCOOPPEE NSI paid overtime and extended hours policy. PPRROOCCEEDDUURREE The procedure for this policy is outlined below . GGEENNEERRAALL PPOOLLIICCYY AANNDD PPRROOCCEEDDUURREE All employees will be paid onc e per month on the last work day of the month. For paydays falling on a Saturday or holiday, you will be paid the prior business day. For paydays falling on a Sunday, you will be paid the following business day. NSI highly encourages all employees to use d irect deposit of their checks. If you are absent on payday and someone else is to pick up your check, it will not be released without a s igned, handwritten note from you authorizing the named person to pick it up. The person designated to pick up your check will be asked to produce identification satisfactory to management; otherwise, your check will not be released. Any deviations from thi s procedure must have prior approval from the NSI CE O. It is NSI's standard policy to expect all professional (exempt) employees to complete their assignments working no more than 40 hours per week. Notwithstanding, NSI recognizes that occasional situatio ns arise that require professional staff to work extended hours (more than 40 hours per week). Paid overtime (exceeding 40 hours per week) for salaried employees, at a straight hourly rate, will be used only in the event of special staffing requirements th at cannot be satisfied by any other reasonable means. Such additional pay, where approved by the employee supervisor an d NSI C EO, will be at an amount equivalent to 1/40th of the employee’s regular weekly salary for each extra hour worked. Vacation, sick/personal and holiday pay will be paid on the regular pay cycle. If you resign, final settlement of services or wages wi ll be made no earlier than the next regular pay cycle, or in accordance with state law, whichever is sooner. If you are terminated, you w ill be issued a check on the next regular payday, or in accordance with applicable state law, whichever is earlier. Payout of vacation will be limited to 160 hours. There will be no payout for sick/personal leave. AAPPPPLLIICCAABBIILLIITTYY This po licy applies to all employees; however an individual's treatment under this policy is dependent upon their employment status (exempt vs. n on-exempt). Exempt employees are typically salaried or part -time hourly professionals that have a large degree of freedom in deciding how to accomplish their work tasks. They are referred to as 'exempt' because certain labor laws, that guarantee such thing s as overt ime pay, do not apply to them. Non -exempt personnel are typically employees that work on an hourly basis in non - professional po sitions where they exercise a limited amount of discretion. PPRROOCCEEDDUURREE It should be recognized that overtime and additi onal work other than that which is regularly scheduled might be required. Overtime will be paid to eligible, non -exempt employees in acco rdance with applicable state law. The pay for regular overtime will be at the federal or state prescribed wage rate, wh ichever is higher. All overtime must be authorized prior to its occurrence by your immediate supervisor and the NSI CE O. All overtime wi ll be clearly noted on your time sheet and should be initialed by your immediate supervisor. Managers that supervise no n-exempt employees may authorize overtime to the extent that the associated NSI, Inc. Policies and Procedures Page 50 of 74 www.NSIteam .com costs do not exceed their budget. Overtime must be authorized in advance by the NSI C EO and the authorizing manager who is then responsible for ensuring that the overtime is utiliz ed efficiently and effectively. Non-Exempt Employee Overtime Managers that supervise non- exempt employees may authorize overtime to the extent that the associated costs do not exceed their budget. Overtime must be authorized in advance and the authorizing manager is responsible for ensuring that the overtime is utilized efficiently and effectively. NSI will pay pre -authorized overtime to non -exempt hourly employees at the rate of 150% for all time worked in excess of 40 hours in a one week pay period. Exempt Employee Overtime The NSI CE O will consider authorizing extended hours (extra pay for exempt personnel) under the following circumst ances: − There are pending staffing requirements that cannot be effectively met by: o moving personnel between assignments ; o requesting contract extensions; or o the use of contract personnel. − The staffing dilemma cannot be resolved by staff increases either bec ause: o the need is too short -term in nature to make hiring a prudent decision, or o the required talent is not readily ava ilable in the labor market. The NSI CE O will review the work backlog on all ongoing contracts and determine which jobs, if any, should be candidates for extended hours. If a decision is made to evoke extended hours under any contract, employees will be in formed in writing by an “Extended Hours Notice” that specifies the anticipated period of extended hours and the contracts affected. This notice, by itself, does not authorize additional pay, but rather, informs employees that NSI is in extended hour’s mode on specific contracts. Additional pay for extra hours worked by an exempt employee must also be verbally authorized by the Project Mana ger prior to being worked. After the Extended Hours Notice is given, the Project Manager should coordinate additional h ours worked with individual project personnel. The following items should be mutually agreed to during the authorization discussion betwe en the Project Manager and the employee: − The number of hours the employee is expected to work during the extended hour s period (or shorter period, such as the next week, if more appropriate). − The technical objectives the employee will direct his efforts t owards during such additional hours. − A general agreement on the time (i.e. week- ends, nights) and place (i.e. home, off ice) where the additional hours will be worked. − If an employee feels that additional time is needed to accomplish certain technical objec tives, he must secure the Project Manager's verbal approval prior to expending the additional time. All professional ( exempt) staff working extended hours will be paid at a rate equivalent to 1/40th of their weekly salary for the number of hours worked in excess of the calendar month's normal billable hours (calculated by multiplying the number of week days in the calenda r month by 8).

NSI, Inc. Policies and Procedures Page 49 of 74 www.NSIteam .com PPOOLLIICCYY NNOO.. 001166:: PPAAIIDD OOVVEERRTTIIMMEE AANNDD EEXXTTEENNDDEEDD HHOOUURRSS PPUURRPPOOSSEE The purpose of this policy is to document the policy for the conditions under which pai d overtime and extended hours will be authorized and how it will be managed by NSI. SSCCOOPPEE NSI paid overtime and extended hours policy. PPRROOCCEEDDUURREE The procedure for this policy is outlined below . GGEENNEERRAALL PPOOLLIICCYY AANNDD PPRROOCCEEDDUURREE All employees will be paid onc e per month on the last work day of the month. For paydays falling on a Saturday or holiday, you will be paid the prior business day. For paydays falling on a Sunday, you will be paid the following business day. NSI highly encourages all employees to use d irect deposit of their checks. If you are absent on payday and someone else is to pick up your check, it will not be released without a s igned, handwritten note from you authorizing the named person to pick it up. The person designated to pick up your check will be asked to produce identification satisfactory to management; otherwise, your check will not be released. Any deviations from thi s procedure must have prior approval from the NSI CE O. It is NSI's standard policy to expect all professional (exempt) employees to complete their assignments working no more than 40 hours per week. Notwithstanding, NSI recognizes that occasional situatio ns arise that require professional staff to work extended hours (more than 40 hours per week). Paid overtime (exceeding 40 hours per week) for salaried employees, at a straight hourly rate, will be used only in the event of special staffing requirements th at cannot be satisfied by any other reasonable means. Such additional pay, where approved by the employee supervisor an d NSI C EO, will be at an amount equivalent to 1/40th of the employee’s regular weekly salary for each extra hour worked. Vacation, sick/personal and holiday pay will be paid on the regular pay cycle. If you resign, final settlement of services or wages wi ll be made no earlier than the next regular pay cycle, or in accordance with state law, whichever is sooner. If you are terminated, you w ill be issued a check on the next regular payday, or in accordance with applicable state law, whichever is earlier. Payout of vacation will be limited to 160 hours. There will be no payout for sick/personal leave. AAPPPPLLIICCAABBIILLIITTYY This po licy applies to all employees; however an individual's treatment under this policy is dependent upon their employment status (exempt vs. n on-exempt). Exempt employees are typically salaried or part -time hourly professionals that have a large degree of freedom in deciding how to accomplish their work tasks. They are referred to as 'exempt' because certain labor laws, that guarantee such thing s as overt ime pay, do not apply to them. Non -exempt personnel are typically employees that work on an hourly basis in non - professional po sitions where they exercise a limited amount of discretion. PPRROOCCEEDDUURREE It should be recognized that overtime and additi onal work other than that which is regularly scheduled might be required. Overtime will be paid to eligible, non -exempt employees in acco rdance with applicable state law. The pay for regular overtime will be at the federal or state prescribed wage rate, wh ichever is higher. All overtime must be authorized prior to its occurrence by your immediate supervisor and the NSI CE O. All overtime wi ll be clearly noted on your time sheet and should be initialed by your immediate supervisor. Managers that supervise no n-exempt employees may authorize overtime to the extent that the associated NSI, Inc. Policies and Procedures Page 50 of 74 www.NSIteam .com costs do not exceed their budget. Overtime must be authorized in advance by the NSI C EO and the authorizing manager who is then responsible for ensuring that the overtime is utiliz ed efficiently and effectively. Non-Exempt Employee Overtime Managers that supervise non- exempt employees may authorize overtime to the extent that the associated costs do not exceed their budget. Overtime must be authorized in advance and the authorizing manager is responsible for ensuring that the overtime is utilized efficiently and effectively. NSI will pay pre -authorized overtime to non -exempt hourly employees at the rate of 150% for all time worked in excess of 40 hours in a one week pay period. Exempt Employee Overtime The NSI CE O will consider authorizing extended hours (extra pay for exempt personnel) under the following circumst ances: − There are pending staffing requirements that cannot be effectively met by: o moving personnel between assignments ; o requesting contract extensions; or o the use of contract personnel. − The staffing dilemma cannot be resolved by staff increases either bec ause: o the need is too short -term in nature to make hiring a prudent decision, or o the required talent is not readily ava ilable in the labor market. The NSI CE O will review the work backlog on all ongoing contracts and determine which jobs, if any, should be candidates for extended hours. If a decision is made to evoke extended hours under any contract, employees will be in formed in writing by an “Extended Hours Notice” that specifies the anticipated period of extended hours and the contracts affected. This notice, by itself, does not authorize additional pay, but rather, informs employees that NSI is in extended hour’s mode on specific contracts. Additional pay for extra hours worked by an exempt employee must also be verbally authorized by the Project Mana ger prior to being worked. After the Extended Hours Notice is given, the Project Manager should coordinate additional h ours worked with individual project personnel. The following items should be mutually agreed to during the authorization discussion betwe en the Project Manager and the employee: − The number of hours the employee is expected to work during the extended hour s period (or shorter period, such as the next week, if more appropriate). − The technical objectives the employee will direct his efforts t owards during such additional hours. − A general agreement on the time (i.e. week- ends, nights) and place (i.e. home, off ice) where the additional hours will be worked. − If an employee feels that additional time is needed to accomplish certain technical objec tives, he must secure the Project Manager's verbal approval prior to expending the additional time. All professional ( exempt) staff working extended hours will be paid at a rate equivalent to 1/40th of their weekly salary for the number of hours worked in excess of the calendar month's normal billable hours (calculated by multiplying the number of week days in the calenda r month by 8).
